# This comprehensive workflow performs Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
# 1. Runs unit tests with pytest.
# 2. If tests pass, it builds the Docker image.
# 3. Pushes the validated image to Docker Hub.
# 4. **NEW: Pulls the image, runs a container, and performs an integration test.**
